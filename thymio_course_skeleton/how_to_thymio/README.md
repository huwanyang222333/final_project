   1. Main computer
   2. Connection wires 
   3. Support blocks (lego pieces)

4. Wireless antenna 


### Steps to assemble the MyT

Before starting the assemble process **carefully verify** that:

1. The printed numbers on the base, wifi antenna and main computer are the same. If this is not the case look for the correct one or request help.
2. The switch on the right of the main computer is **turned down**.

To assemble the MyT follow the next steps:

1. Carefully pull off the parts from the box.

> If the support blocks are detached, follow the images in the [appendices](#appendices) section to put them back together. **Do not** continue with the assembling process until the support blocks are properly connected.

2. Mount the main computer block on top of the Thymio base:

Once the MyT is assembled, pull the battery out a couple of centimeters and push the small button on the side of the battery; a few leds on the battery will light up to indicate its charge level.  Always make sure the external battery pack is properly charged, otherwise the system may be unstable.  If the system is properly assembled, a blue LED on top of the switch in main computer should turn on.
